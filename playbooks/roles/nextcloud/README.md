# Nextcloud Role

Install the [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) client along with a systemd
service to start it automatically.

## Usage

The Nextcloud client should start automatically with `xsession.target`. On first
start you'll have to login to a Nextcloud instance -- I've been using
`shed.pocketknife.io`.
