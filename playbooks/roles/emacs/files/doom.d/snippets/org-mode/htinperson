Hi ${1:`(my-yas-get-first-name-from-to-field)`},

Your take home test looks ${2:solid} -- we'd like to fly you out to Los Angeles so you can meet the rest of the team and check out the office!

HealthTensor will cover up to \$500 in travel expenses, e.g. flights, hotel, and food while you're on the road. Typically, people fly out to LAX the day before the interview to stay in a hotel between LAX and Santa Monica, and then fly out the evening after the interview.

For the day of the interview you'll be at the office from 10:00a - 5:00p (PT). The office is located at 1336 Princeton St, Santa Monica, CA. Is there a date after ${3:DATE} you can meet with us in-person during that window?

Once you let me know I'll set up the calendar events and send you more information on the day's format.

In the meantime, please let me know if you have any employment opportunities which will force your hand -- we might be able to expedite the decision-making on our end.

Cheers,
-${4:Thomas}
