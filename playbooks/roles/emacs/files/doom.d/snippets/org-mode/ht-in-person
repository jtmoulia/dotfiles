Hi $1,

Congratulations on doing a solid job on the coding screener -- we'd love to
invite you to the office for in-person interview. You'll get to meet the entire
team and work through some more in-depth technical questions.

Is there any day next week you could meet for an in-person interview? Thursday
is ideal for us, but we can also make other days work. For context, the
interviews would run from ~ 9a - 3p and include lunch.

Our office is located at 4133 Redwood Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90066

Once we nail down a date I can send further information.

Excited to chat further,
-Thomas
