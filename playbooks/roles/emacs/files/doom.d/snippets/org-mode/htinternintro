Hello ${1:`(my-yas-get-first-name-from-to-field)`},

${2:Thank you for applying to HealthTensor!} We really like your background and want to move you forward in our summer internship interview. The next step is a 45min chat where we can talk about the role and work through a technical problem or two.

For the technical part of the interview youâ€™ll implement a solution using Python in your local dev environment while the interviewer observes over screenshare. Familiarity with algorithms and data structures will help; check out GeeksforGeeks for practice problems roughly comparable in difficulty and duration [1]

If we agree that you're a good fit, the next steps are a 3hr take-home project followed by a 3hr in-person interview.

If you're interested, let's schedule the technical interview. To make scheduling easier I've put my availability on Calendly, so you can grab a time here that works for you: https://calendly.com/thomas-moulia/hiring-intro

Thank you,
-${4:Thomas Moulia}
