Hello ${1:`(my-yas-get-first-name-from-to-field)`},

Thank you for applying to HealthTensor! We really like your background and want to move you forward in our interview process for the UI / UX designer position. The next step is a 30min chat where we can talk about the role and answer any questions which you have.

To make scheduling easier I've put my availability on Calendly, so you can grab a time here that works for you: https://calendly.com/thomas-moulia/30min/

In case it's applicable: we are unable to sponsor visa applications for this role; you should have authorization to work in the US for at least two years.

Thank you,
-${4:Thomas Moulia}
