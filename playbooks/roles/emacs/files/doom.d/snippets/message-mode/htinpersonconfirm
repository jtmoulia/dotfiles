Hello ${1:CANDIDATE},

Great -- let's plan on $2.

You should plan on being at the office from 10am - 4pm. During that time you'll spend about an hour with each of the three co-founders as well as one of the full-timers [1]. We're interested in getting to know you, as well as working through some problems together. Please bring your laptop so we can do some coding [2].

Lunch is on us.

As for dress code, we don't have one. I'll be dressed casually, but please wear whatever makes you feel comfortable.

The office address is 4133 Redwood Ave, Los Angeles CA, 90066. If you give me a call when you arrive at (707) 267 8782 I can meet you out on the street. There should be street parking available on Redwood Ave, but it's a mix of two hour and unmetered -- be sure to check the signs.

HealthTensor will cover your travel expenses. Save and submit your receipts after the interview for reimbursement.

Please give me a call if you're having issues at any point.

Cheers,
-Thomas

2. If you'd like to prepare for the technical portion I recommend reviewing data structures
