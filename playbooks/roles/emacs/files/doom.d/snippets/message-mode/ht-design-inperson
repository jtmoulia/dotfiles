Hi ${1:`(my-yas-get-first-name-from-to-field)`},

Great -- we're excited that you'll be interviewing with us! It'll be an opportunity for us to learn more about your background and working style, as well as answer your questions about HealthTensor.

We'll get started right at ${2:10am}, so please plan on being in the office from $2 to about ${3:2:30pm}. The office is located at 4133 Redwood Ave, #1016. Half the block is 2-hour parking and the other half is open. Just call when you get to the building & we'll meet you outside: (707) 267-8782

Most of the day will be spent on three interviews, each running about an hour. You'll get a break for lunch, where we'll take you to one of our local options.

To help have a productive discussion please plan to briefly (15min) present a project from your portfolio to the team followed by about 30min of discussion. The idea is that you pick a project you feel comfortable explaining -- you don't need a polished presentation, just a few visual aids or explainers that show the steps in your process, and you're welcome to reuse prior materials.

Ideally the project you pick will let us dig into how you:

  - gather specifications for the problem
  - work with users/data to develop options
  - gather feedback and iterate on design based upon feedback
  - collaborate with cross-functional team members to share progress and solicit feedback

Let me know if you have any questions!

Cheers,
-${4:Thomas Moulia}
