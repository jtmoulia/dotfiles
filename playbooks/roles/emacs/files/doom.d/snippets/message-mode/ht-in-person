Hi $1,

Congratulations on doing a solid job on the coding screener -- we'd love to
invite you to the office for in-person interview. You'll get to meet the entire
team and work through some more in-depth technical questions.

Is there any you could meet next week from say 9a - 3p)

in the new year. Will you be in Los Angeles the week of January 6th? Is there a
particular day that week that would work best for you? For context, the
interviews would likely run from ~ 9a - 3p and include lunch.

Our office is located at 4133 Redwood Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90066

Congrats again,
-Thomas
