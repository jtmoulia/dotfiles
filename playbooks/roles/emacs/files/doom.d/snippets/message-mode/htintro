Hello ${1:`(my-yas-get-first-name-from-to-field)`},

Thank you for applying to HealthTensor! We really like your background and want to move you forward in our interview process. The next step is a 45min chat where we can talk about the role and work through a technical problem.

For the technical part of the interview you’ll implement a solution in your local dev environment while the interviewer observes over screenshare. You’re welcome to use whatever tools/languages you’re comfortable with. Familiarity with algorithms and data structures will help; check out GeeksforGeeks for [hard] practice problems [1]

If we agree that you're a good fit, the following steps are a 3hr take-home project followed by a 3hr in-person interview.

To make scheduling easier I've put my availability on Calendly, so you can grab a time here that works for you: https://calendly.com/thomas-moulia/hiring-intro

In case it's applicable: we are unable to sponsor visa applications for this role; you should have authorization to work in the US for at least two years.

Thank you,
-${4:Thomas Moulia}
