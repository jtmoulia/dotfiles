Thanks, Eli! Moving you to Bcc to spare you the scheduling noise.

Hi ${1:`(my-yas-get-first-name-from-to-field)`},

I'm excited to hear that you're interested in HealthTensor -- I'd love to chat further and work through a technical problem.

Is there a 45min slot between 2-5p PT which works for you? I've put my availability on calendly to help out with the back and forth; when you get a chance please book a time which is convenient for you:

Also, don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions.

Thank you,
-Thomas Moulia
