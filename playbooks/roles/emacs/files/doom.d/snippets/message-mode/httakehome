Hi ${1:`(my-yas-get-first-name-from-to-field)`},

I enjoyed speaking with you, and you put together a solid solution for the keyword question -- I'm happy to invite you to the next stage of our interview, the take home project.

I've attached the prompt and data as a .tar.gz file [1]. There is a README.md within detailing the tasks for this take home project.

You should aim to complete your solution in about three hours. That being said you aren't being tracked, nor are you expected to get to the project right away.

As always, feel free to reply with any questions or concerns. $0

Cheers,
-Thomas

1. To expand the .tar.gz, move it to the dir you want it unpacked in and run:

    tar -xzf ht-take-home.tar.gz
